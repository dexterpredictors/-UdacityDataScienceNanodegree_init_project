## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here except for the Anaconda distribution of Python.  
To make sure the code runs with no issues, please use Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was using the Seattle AirBnB homes data to answer following 3 questions:

1.  Can we train a model which could predict review_scores_rating with mae < 10?
2.  Can we identify a useful set of features with meaningful impact on target?
3.  How do prices of apartments vary by number of beds available?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@mt.svitek/can-machine-learning-be-a-revenue-booster-in-your-airbnb-business-522a7450b972?sk=1fcf306bdc77caafb09f994d43c05ed2).
